Facebook is a bit fussy with that. I looked into it a bit, and there might be ways around it, but the official way is to use the code that you copy and pasted into this card below.\n\nThis code produces a long line, which doesn't let it self be styled, or broken up, since it basically loads a mini browser within the page. \n\nI can look into it a bit more, but for now it can't really go next to the image, it doesn't fit, let alone use the Like-us-on-Facebook.png' graphic. See comment below as well.","card":{"id":"537abe45e779217ca7421c6d","name":"Changes to share/facebook button","idShort":84,"shortLink":"SSvp8JKx"},"board":{"id":"52c4c3d9e238985c79023492","name":"Firstdoor","shortLink":"5D1ldAUC"}},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-06-26T00:53:21.173Z","memberCreator":{"id":"52c4c583101ead8a34004a4d","avatarHash":"84d74e2852ca624c2482d6369051b69d","fullName":"Michiel van Oosten","initials":"MO","username":"michielvanoosten"}},{"id":"53ab3bce7d0c810fb62fc0c3","idMemberCreator":"52c62db64a09af1151007094","data":{"board":{"shortLink":"5D1ldAUC","name":"Firstdoor","id":"52c4c3d9e238985c79023492"},"card":{"shortLink":"SSvp8JKx","idShort":84,"name":"Changes to share/facebook button","id":"537abe45e779217ca7421c6d"},"text":"Is there a problem with positioning the Like Us on Facebook link where it is shown on the new layout pdf doc attached?"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-06-25T21:14:54.500Z","memberCreator":{"id":"52c62db64a09af1151007094","avatarHash":"01bca087f42177380becf90f4e0e5ea5","fullName":"Andrea","initials":"A","username":"andrea377"}},{"id":"53aa3a4004e3b18a0add90a7","idMemberCreator":"52c4c583101ead8a34004a4d","data":{"board":{"shortLink":"5D1ldAUC","name":"Firstdoor","id":"52c4c3d9e238985c79023492"},"card":{"shortLink":"tmwmEPBo","idShort":105,"name":"Minor look adjustments","id":"53aa39be3f6990a5090ef862","pos":854015.5},"old":{"pos":2162687}},"type":"updateCard","date":"2014-06-25T02:56:00.942Z","memberCreator":{"id":"52c4c583101ead8a34004a4d","avatarHash":"84d74e2852ca624c2482d6369051b69d","fullName":"Michiel van Oosten","initials":"MO","username":"michielvanoosten"}},{"id":"53aa3a00fc9967c1b40a2568","idMemberCreator":"52c4c583101ead8a34004a4d","data":{"board":{"shortLink":"5D1ldAUC","name":"Firstdoor","id":"52c4c3d9e238985c79023492"},"card":{"shortLink":"tmwmEPBo","idShort":105,"name":"Minor look adjustments","id":"53aa39be3f6990a5090ef862","desc":"The Nationally Recognised logo is too close to ‘Connect with us’.

Can the NRT logo go back to it's original positioning please? It would be good to have the apprenticeship envelope button on all pages. Perhaps later on we could reduce down to home and accredited training pages only, but for now the more pages the better! If it is possible to have the envelope button on the top of the green door that would be good. It might help break up the green a bit that way too. Is it possible to make the words \"Find out more!\" to operate as a hyperlink, or would we need a new image with no writing here to do this? I tried linking in the Apprenticeship information, however I can't access the dpeditor link at the moment. I've saved the document in the public dropbox ready. There is also another document to hyperlink called Apprenticeship fees FAQ. But I need to be able to alter the text slightly for this one.

The one for humans is for bots as well really. No more hashes and bangs means google can crawl the site properly. The site is able to respond to a bot with a static page (non-javascript) page, but so far the crawler tests I've had google do retrieve the full page, even better. \n\nThe site is serving properly compressed and minified resources, properly cached on the server and then again  behind a content delivery network (clouldflare), which means I get very few requests through to the actual server, which is good. Depending on how often you want to update the site, I can reduce the load even more. \n\nThe site is up for testing at firstdoor.axion5.net I went through it carefully, but I probably missed things. And things still can go wrong. So if you can test it as well then after a couple of weeks I can make it go live and replace the current site.\n\nI will then submit the site map to all search engines. Search engine optimization will depend on google being able to crawl the site properly, which it will. The second thing is to have other sites link to firstdoor.com.au. That's what google really relies on for ranking. Have you submitted firstdoor already as a business to google places? So it shows up on google maps?\n\nAttached is a report. Site is getting scores of over 90/100. I can still optimize some images, and serve part of the resources from a different domain, the rest is the sharethis buttons and google analytics, out of my hands. \n\nBoth the test site and the real one are running on my own Linode server. I would like to sign you up with somewhere else then nodejitsu, updating the site on there takes ages, fails now and then, and I can't get at the backend. Prices are from about $10/month, Linode is $20/month, but has a lot of support for the developer,, now I know what I am doing a bit, I can set it up somewhere cheaper if you'd prefer that.","card":{"id":"52c5452eb151e8e1760130cf","name":"SEO and XML sitemap","idShort":20,"shortLink":"CQLIY9iF"},"board":{"id":"52c4c3d9e238985c79023492","name":"Firstdoor","shortLink":"5D1ldAUC"}},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-02-22T12:33:20.806Z","memberCreator":{"id":"52c4c583101ead8a34004a4d","avatarHash":"84d74e2852ca624c2482d6369051b69d","fullName":"Michiel van Oosten","initials":"MO","username":"michielvanoosten"}},{"id":"5308952e060fbc7e3c754ea6","idMemberCreator":"52c4c583101ead8a34004a4d","data":{"board":{"shortLink":"5D1ldAUC","name":"Firstdoor","id":"52c4c3d9e238985c79023492"},"card":{"shortLink":"CQLIY9iF","idShort":20,"name":"SEO and XML sitemap","id":"52c5452eb151e8e1760130cf"},"attachment":{"url":"https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/52c4c3d9e238985c79023492/52c5452eb151e8e1760130cf/e6e9946a21a102ef462d25079f34e397/GTmetrix-report-firstdoor.axion5.com-20140222T033737-aASRAtRe-full.pdf","name":"GTmetrix-report-firstdoor.axion5.com-20140222T033737-aASRAtRe-full.pdf","id":"5308952d060fbc7e3c754ea5"}},"type":"addAttachmentToCard","date":"2014-02-22T12:16:46.544Z","memberCreator":{"id":"52c4c583101ead8a34004a4d","avatarHash":"84d74e2852ca624c2482d6369051b69d","fullName":"Michiel van Oosten","initials":"MO","username":"michielvanoosten"}},{"id":"5308947cec62c24859de1082","idMemberCreator":"52c4c583101ead8a34004a4d","data":{"board":{"shortLink":"5D1ldAUC","name":"Firstdoor","id":"52c4c3d9e238985c79023492"},"card":{"shortLink":"MIyVZ5mh","idShort":37,"name":"Proper urls, so no index.html#!, not even #!

So no more comment on the first line and it works again.\n \nSupport and usage of IE7 is dropping across  the web, and the site doesn't really work  in IE7, I wouldn't know how to get it working anyway, since there are no developer tools in the browser, but I think I already sent you an email about that.\n\nSo if a site is not coming out properly, check first if it they are using IE7, came out in 2006, worldwide usage is under 1%, so not very likely they are still using IE7, but if they do suggest they upgrade.\n\nIE8 and IE9 and IE10 should work properly.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the hiccup, another lesson learned, I should always keep testing in IE, no matter how small the change apparently. I made the change somewhere this week, so the site should  have been working fine till then in IE.\n\nI am leaving this site as is for now, and use another site to test out changes, once we're both happy with the change I will update the live site.","card":{"id":"52fb17ae7aeeefe941f3874d","name":"I've been showing a few Directors our website and if they don't use Google Chrome it comes up very messy - large size font in some places that distorts the layout.","idShort":52,"shortLink":"meW7DIvQ"},"board":{"id":"52c4c3d9e238985c79023492","name":"Firstdoor","shortLink":"5D1ldAUC"}},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-02-12T23:42:58.174Z","memberCreator":{"id":"52c4c583101ead8a34004a4d","avatarHash":"84d74e2852ca624c2482d6369051b69d","fullName":"Michiel van Oosten","initials":"MO","username":"michielvanoosten"}},{"id":"52fbefdf9f3c75f747bcfa8f","idMemberCreator":"52c4c583101ead8a34004a4d","data":{"board":{"shortLink":"5D1ldAUC","name":"Firstdoor","id":"52c4c3d9e238985c79023492"},"card":{"shortLink":"meW7DIvQ","idShort":52,"name":"I've been showing a few Directors our website and if they don't use Google Chrome it comes up very messy - large size font in some places that distorts the layout.","id":"52fb17ae7aeeefe941f3874d"},"text":"It works in IE10, funny things happening in IE7-9.
